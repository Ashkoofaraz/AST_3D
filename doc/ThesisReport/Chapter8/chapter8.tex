\label{conclusion}

Creating a team's framework from scratch was a big challenge especially when this project does not depend in any other third party software's part except from motions files and the dynamic programming implementation created by UT Austin Villa. In general, teams participating in this league consists of more than two members in most cases. It is my personal belief that in order to be competitive in this league there has to be a team effort in which each member should concentrate in a single part of the whole problem.
