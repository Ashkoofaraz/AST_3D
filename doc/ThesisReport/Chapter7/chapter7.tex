\chapter{Future Work}
\label{future}
This is just a small , but well founded step towards our notion of the ideal communication framework for robotic teams and other similar distributed systems. Thus, there are plans for extending, adding and optimizing further the proposed framework.

\section{Optimization and Debugging}

Every project, no matter how well it is tested optimized during the development phase after it is released bugs, bottlenecks are found. Our intention and desire is to continue to actively develop Narukom in order to meet the needs of as many people as possible. As a result a constant procedure of optimizing , debgugin and testing is needed to ensure that Narukom is a robust, easy to use framework.
