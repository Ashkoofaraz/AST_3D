\section{Software's Conversion}
This is a major issue that has to be resolved immediately. There are things to be changed in order our team to meet the standards of the new Server's Version 0.6.6 in which there are some changes with the most important one that there are now eleven players for each side. It will be easy to make these changes in our source code, as the whole code is written in a way that allows these changes to be done easily.


\section{Participation in Robocup}
Robocup is a well-known competition in which everybody want to take part.
Since I started this project, during the last winter semester in the course of Autonomous Agents, I was having the ambition for our team to participate in this league.

\section{Dynamic Movement}
Most of the teams which have been participating in the Robocup's simulation soccer league make use of dynamic movement. This is a major drawback
for our side and I hope this issue to be resolved in the near future.

\section{Optimization and Debugging}
Every project, no matter how well it is tested optimized during the development phase. I think that there are weak spots in the source code which have to be optimized.
